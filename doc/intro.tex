\Chapter{Introduction}

{\LOOPS} is a package for \package{GAP4} whose purpose is to:
\beginlist%unordered
\item{$\circ$}
    provide researchers in nonassociative algebra with a powerful computational tool
    concerning finite loops and quasigroups,
\item{$\circ$}
    extend {\GAP} toward the realm of nonassociative structures.
\endlist

\Section{Installation}

We assume that you have \package{GAP 4.4} or newer installed on your computer.
Download the {\LOOPS} package from the distribution website

\URL{http://www.math.du.edu/loops}

and unpack the downloaded file into the `pkg' subfolder of your {\GAP} folder.

After this step, there should be a subfolder `loops' in your `pkg' folder. The
package {\LOOPS} can then be loaded to {\GAP} anytime by calling
\begintt
LoadPackage("loops");
\endtt
If you wish to load {\LOOPS} automatically while starting {\GAP}, open the file
`loops/PackageInfo.g', and change `Autoload:=false' to
`Autoload:=true' in the file.

\Section{Documentation}

The documentation is available is several formats: \TeX, pdf, dvi, pdf, html,
and as an online help in {\GAP}. All these formats have been obtained directly
from the master {\TeX} documentation file. Consequently, the different formats
of the documentation differ only in their appearance, not in content.

The documentation can be found in the `doc' folder of {\LOOPS} and also at the
{\LOOPS} distribution website.

The online {\GAP} help is available upon installing {\LOOPS}, and can be
accessed in the usual way, i.e., upon typing `?'<command>, {\GAP} displays the
section of the {\LOOPS} manual containing information about <command>.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Test files}

Test files conforming to the {\GAP} standards are provided for {\LOOPS}. They
can be found in the folder `tst' and run in the usual way.

The file `testall.g' runs all tests for {\LOOPS}.

\Section{Feedback}

We welcome all comments and suggestions on {\LOOPS}, especially those
concerning the future development of the package. You can contact us by e-mail.
